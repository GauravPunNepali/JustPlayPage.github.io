                    <p>Can you hear my heartbeat?
                        Tired of feeling never enough
                        I close my eyes and tell myself
                        That my dreams will come true
                        There'll be no more darkness
                        When you believe in yourself
                        You are unstoppable
                        Where your destiny lies
                        Dancing on the blades
                        You set my heart on fire
                            Don't stop us now
                            The moment of truth
                            We were born to make history
                            We'll make it happen
                            We'll turn it around
                            Yes, we were born to make
                            History
                            Born to make history
                            Born to make history
